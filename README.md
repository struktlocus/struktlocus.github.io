# StruktLocus — Universal Structural Language

**StruktLocus** is an experimental artificial language based entirely on structural semantics. It separates meaning from lexicon by assigning fixed semantic roles to positional slots, making it ideal for machine processing, cross-cultural communication, and cognitive experiments.

## 🌐 Overview

StruktLocus proposes a radical shift in linguistic design:

- ✅ **Positional Semantics**: Meaning is determined *only* by position, not by word choice.
- 🧠 **Cognitive Clarity**: Eliminates lexical ambiguity and cultural bias.
- 🤖 **AI-Ready**: Easily parsed by machines without complex NLP models.
- 🌍 **Universal Access**: Supports mixed expressions using emoji, mathematical symbols, and elements from different languages.

## 🧱 Core Grammar

Each utterance is a **Structural Quantum (SQ)** consisting of 6 fixed positions:

| Position | Role         | Description                          |
|----------|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1        | FOCUS        | Central element or topic             |
| 2        | ORIENTATOR   | Source, subject, or direction        |
| 3        | DYNAMA       | Core action, state, or change        |
| 4        | RELATOR      | Type of connection or relation       |
| 5        | OBJECT       | Target or result                     |
| 6        | MODUS        | Circumstance, time, or modality      |

**Example:**

[1:philosophy] [2:I] [3:?] [4:about] [5:meaning] [6:possibly] => I contemplate the meaning of philosophy


## 🚀 Applications

- **Cross-Cultural Communication**: Uses neutral symbols for universal meaning.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: No ambiguity, perfect for knowledge representation.
- **Education**: Teaches logic and abstract structures without vocabulary load.
- **Cognitive Science**: Explores language-independent thought.
